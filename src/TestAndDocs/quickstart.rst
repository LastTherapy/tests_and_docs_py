Quickstart Guide
================

This guide will help you quickly set up and start working with the project.

1. **Install the required dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies for the project:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Run the project**:

   After installing the dependencies, you can run the main script using the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python3 main.py

3. **Run the tests**:

   You can run the project's tests using the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pytest -s tests

4. **View the documentation**:

   If you want to view this documentation locally, you can build it using Sphinx. Navigate to the documentation directory and run:

   .. code-block:: bash

       make html

   Once the documentation is built, open the following file in your browser:

   .. code-block:: bash

       _build/html/index.html

   This will open the main page of the documentation, including detailed information on the project's modules, functions, and classes.
